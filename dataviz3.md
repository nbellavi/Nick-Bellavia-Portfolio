This data visualization and the associated data come from The Washington Post and their database that keeps track of President Trump's false claims (found here: https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/trump-claims-database/?tid=lk_inline_manual_22&tid=lk_inline_manual_26&tid=lk_inline_manual_31&tid=lk_inline_manual_35&itid=lk_inline_manual_35&itid=lk_inline_manual_42

I was interested in trying to create a new visualization about the current pandemic and thought this data presented a cool opportunity to see if there are any patterns between an increase in coronavirus cases and President Trump's false statements. I chose this visualization because it was the only one I found that looked at it from a daily perspective but within the visualization I could not find a way to change the scale to make it more clear. Further, I thought the data could be better represented by a line graph than a bar graph and improved in other ways for people also seeking this information.

# Process
At first, my critique process was simply taking a look at the layout of the data visualization and colors. My first initial impression was that this visualization could be presented in way that more clearly displays the data. I also thought that the colors used were effective and I wanted to try and carry that over to my redesign. Stephen Few's Data Visualization Effectiveness profile caused me to look at some other aspects of the visualization that I might not have otherwise. I began to consider things like truthfulness, perceptibility, and engagement. For me, the perceptibility was an area that I really wanted to try and improve. Truthfulness was another aspect I wanted to make sure was reliable. I believe the source (The Washington Post) conducted diligent and honest research. While the bar graph was an appropriate way to display this data, I thought a line graph might work better.

This led me to begin sketiching and wireframing using pen, paper, and coloring tools. I started with sketching a redesign of false and misleading statements over Jan-July. Then, I also thought it might be worth a try to compare the false and misleading claims to the daily number of new coronavirus cases. All of this can be seen in the sketches below.

# Feedback

I received a couple of pieces of useful feedback that I wanted to try and implement in my first design. The first feedback was to create a clear title and clear axis names, which I hope I was able to do. I chose to go with the red line and gray for the labels and annotations so as to remain consistent with original visualization. False and misleading statements have a negative connotation which is represented by the red color. It also helps the data to pop against the white background. The other feedback I received was regarding the double y-axis. To both people who looked at, they thought it was slightly confusing and took away from what the visualization was really trying to bring attention to. I listened to this feedback and decided to forego the double y-axis and instead go with some annotations of key dates and key data points. The feedback resulted in the following visualization.

vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);                
</script>

A note about the visualization: I could not figure out how to change the title "Day of Dates" when hovering on a data point.
