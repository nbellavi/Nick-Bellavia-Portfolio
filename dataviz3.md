This data visualization and the associated data come from The Washington Post and their database that keeps track of President Trump's false claims (found here: https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/trump-claims-database/?tid=lk_inline_manual_22&tid=lk_inline_manual_26&tid=lk_inline_manual_31&tid=lk_inline_manual_35&itid=lk_inline_manual_35&itid=lk_inline_manual_42

I was interested in trying to create a new visualization about the current pandemic and thought this data presented a cool opportunity to see if there are any patterns between an increase in coronavirus cases and President Trump's false statements. I chose this visualization because it was the only one I found that looked at it from a daily perspective but within the visualization I could not find a way to change the scale to make it more clear. Further, I thought the data could be better represented by a line graph than a bar graph and improved in other ways for people also seeking this information.
