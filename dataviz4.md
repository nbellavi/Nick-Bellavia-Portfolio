# Introduction

With this project, I am interested in showing the diversity issue in Hollywood through the lens of the Academy Awards. Hollywood has always claimed it is a diverse industry but when it comes to honoring the work of minority groups, there is a lot of room for improvement. The target group for this presentation is people working in the entertainment industry who want to know more about the topic and see an evolution of diversity in Hollywood and learn about ways they can help. For this class, I want people to know some of the things they can do to make movies more diverse and equitable.

As a reader and a viewer of a lot of movies, I want to see more international and minority films recognized at the Academy Awards in the five major individual categories (Best Director, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Supporting Actor, Best Supporting Actress) so that they become well known, more accessible to the average viewer, and a larger part of the public consciousness.


# The Story

The story arc will begin with a general observation. Award shows are fun! It is an opportunity for an industry to recognize its best and brightest. It allows for members to celebrate and have a good time. This is especially true for the film industry and the Academy Awards. Televised every year, people tune in to see what their favorite celebrities are wearing or if their favorite movie will take a home the coveted Oscar statue. But that does not mean that everything has been golden since the first Academy Awards ceremony in 1929. 
In an industry that prides itself on trying to be equitable, the Academy Awards are anything but. Outside of the best actress and best supporting actress categories, the majority of winners have been white males. The Academy has been called out for this lack of diversity many times, but it still continued to happen. It wasn’t until 2015 that the winds began to change with the #OscarsSoWhite movement. Since then, more minority film makers have been recognized in the five major categories, but more work needs to be done. The overall story can be viewed in the draft story arc below.

I will be using Shorthand to complete this project. Shorthand will allow me the opportunity to give some historical context about the Academy Awards since its inception in 1929 and show through data and visuals some statistics that tell the story of improving equality in film awards. It will also allow me to show ways in which diversity has been improved, areas in which the Academy still struggles, and methods that we can all undertake to promote more equality in the entertainment industry, even just as casual viewers.

# The Data

The data used for the project comes from two sources. The first is a publicly accessible list from
Data.World. The data set is titled “Academy Award Demographics” and it shows Oscar winners in the top five award categories since 1929. It also notes the winner’s religion and ethnicity. I will only be using the ethnicity category for this project. Other information used to supplement the list was gathered from the official Academy Award website. The links to the two data sources:

# User Research and Interviews

A.	Target Audience
-The target audience I hope to reach with this story is professionals in the entertainment industry who are interested in learning more about diversity issues and what they can do to help bring about significant change.

B.	Approach to identifying representative individuals
-My approach to identifying individuals to be interviewed was fairly straight forward. I wanted to select people who would give me honest feedback and who would be easily communicated with virtually since we cannot get together. I selected my partner, Carly, who gives me honest feedback. I selected my friend, Dan, who lives in Philadelphia and is also interested in this topic. Finally, I selected my dad, Mark, who would be excited to be involved in one of my projects.

C.	Interview script
-Question 1: What do you think this is?
-Question2: What do you think these visualizations are trying to tell you? Do you think there is a story?
-Question 3: Anything you find surprising, confusing, or unclear?
-Question 4: Who do you think the intended audience is for this?
-Question 5: Is there anything you would want to change or improve?

D.	Findings from interviews

Dan
Question 1: I think this is a series of charts about Hollywood and the Academy Awards.
Question 2: I think these charts are trying to tell me something about diversity, or the lack thereof, in Hollywood. More specifically in the top 5 categories of the Academy Awards. The storyboard/wireframe is an outline of a presentation? I’m not familiar with a wireframe.
Question 3: As someone who pays attention to this subject, I knew there was a lack of diversity in Hollywood but I did not know that it was to this extent. I feel like the visualizations could be a little clearer particularly in the stacked bar visualization. It’s hard to distinguish the other colors besides the gray.
Question 4: I think the intended audience is students in a film school or someone interested in the history of Hollywood. Maybe for people in the industry?
Question 5: One thing I would like to see is an overall comparison of white winners vs. minority winners from 1929-2020. I think doing something like this might help simplify some of the visuals. I’d make sure to create clear titles as well. Also, the key could be confusing to some with color and the ethnicity.

Mark
Question 1: This appears to be charts and an outline of some type about the movie industry and awards given to actors and actresses.
Question 2: I’m not entirely sure. Something about white actors v. minority actors and awards I think. It looks like there have been a lot of white winners since 1929 and not many minority winners although there have been some more in the past few years. 
Question 3: I’m surprised by your ability to sketch. I wish I could say that I’m surprised by this lack of diversity but I’m really not. I am surprised to see it presented in such a visual way.
Question 4: I think the intended audience is other actors and actresses. Possibly students?
Question 5: In the storyboard, I would make sure to focus more on the visualizations instead of the historical context. Keep this brief if possible. Instead of bar graphs, I’d be curious to see what this data would like in a line graph.

Carly

Question 1: Disproportionately white and male award winners. 2019 seems to show improving diversity with a backslide in 2020:
Question 2: I think this is telling me that historically, and potentially still now, there is an underrepresentation of people of color. This seems especially highlighted by director winners.
Question 3: Surprising that in 2020 (on the bar graph) it is back to being primarily white after a very diverse 2019.
Question 4: Anyone in our society, movie watchers, call to action placed on those in the majority to recognize this and for all of us to demand better representation. Audience – maybe those who would deny this as a problem?
Question 5: Clearly notate and label graphs to give context. I’d be curious to know how the numbers compare to the nominees v. the winners. Are the nominees more diverse and the winners more often white? Or do the trends stay consistent?

Planned Revisions to Implement from Feedback

-I need to fine tune some of the colors for clarity.
-I need to create clear titles and make sure the x and y-axis are clearer.
-In the presentation, I think I need to find an appropriate balance of historical context and data
-I want to try and find some data on nominees v. winners but I’m not sure if time will permit for this project.
-I need to make a visualization comparing overall percentages of white v. minority winners.

# Final Data Story

At first, I thought the audience for this project was going to be targeted towards people in the film industry. After I received feedback from numerous people, it became clear that this topic goes beyond just people in the industry. Movies are a reflection of our society and culture. Whether someone likes them or not, it is important to learn about areas were racism and inequity still exist and it is important to learn about it. I changed some of the information to better appeal to a wider audience who may not possess a lot of film knowledge but can learn how they can help to make things better.

The process of this project was eye opening and enjoyable. It is fun to tell stories, but stories can be taken to another level when we have data to support them. I feel that this class prepared me well to think about the design and layout of this project that support the overall story.
Many of the design decisions revolved around color and chart type. Color was something that I was popular and the feedback and I tried to make effective changes. I also tried various charts and thought this data was best represented by the ones in the project. This is a topic that I am very interested, and it is a story that needs to be told over and over again until meaning change is permanent. My process for telling this story began with the idea and continued to evolve as I moved through it. I thought it was appropriate to open the presentation with the problem and then with some brief historical context. The data then follows. As I continued through this project, I came to the realization that it is not fair to say that nothing has changed with regards to diversity and inclusion in Hollywood. It was unequal for a long time, but in the past few years, there have been positive steps forward. It is just that this progress needs to continue.
I hope that the final project reflects this story. For anyone who is interested in movies or interested in learning about ways to make a meaningful change somewhere, I hope they enjoy. This story has been told better before me and will be told better after me, but if it can change one mind, I think it will have been successful.
