# Introduction

With this project, I am interested in showing the diversity issue in Hollywood through the lens of the Academy Awards. Hollywood has always claimed it is a diverse industry but when it comes to honoring the work of minority groups, there is a lot of room for improvement. The target group for this presentation is people working in the entertainment industry who want to know more about the topic and see an evolution of diversity in Hollywood and learn about ways they can help. For this class, I want people to know some of the things they can do to make movies more diverse and equitable.

As a reader and a viewer of a lot of movies, I want to see more international and minority films recognized at the Academy Awards in the five major individual categories (Best Director, so that they become well known, more accessible to average viewer, and a larger part of the public consciousness.


# The Story

The story arc will begin with a general observation. Award shows are fun! It is an opportunity for an industry to recognize its best and brightest. It allows for members to celebrate, drink, and have a good time. This especially true for the film industry and the Academy Awards. Televised every year, people tune in to see what their favorite celebrities are wearing or if their favorite movie will take a home the coveted Oscar statue. But that does not mean that everything has been golden since the first Academy Awards show in 1929. 
In an industry that prides itself on trying to be equitable, the Academy Awards are anything but. Outside of the best actress and best supporting actress categories, the majority of winners of been white males. The Academy has been called out for this lack of diversity many times, but it still continued to happen. It wasn’t until 2015 that the winds began to change with the #OscarsSoWhite movement. Since then, more minority film makers have been recognized in the five major categories, but more work needs to be done. The overall story can be viewed in the draft story arc below.

I will be using Shorthand to complete this project. Shorthand will allow me the opportunity to give some historical context about the Academy Awards since its inception in 1929 and show through data and visuals some statistics that tell the story of improving equality in film awards. It will also allow me to show ways in which diversity has been improved, areas in which the Academy still struggles, and methods that we can all do to promote more equality in the entertainment industry, even as just casual viewers.

# The Data

The data used for the project comes from two sources. The first is a publicly accessible list from
Data.World. The data set is titled “Academy Award Demographics” and it shows Oscar winners in the top five award categories since 1929. It also notes the winner’s religion and ethnicity. I will only be using the ethnicity category for this project. Other information used to supplement the list was gathered from the official Academy Award website. The links to the two data sources:
