# Description of Visualizations

  The first data visualization I tried to construct was a column chart race. I mainly chose this one to see if I could play with the data and set it up in a way that it would work for this visualization. I think this type of chart works for this data because it shows in a brief amount of time the change that these countries experience in their debt to GDP ratio. It also allows the viewer to interact with the visualization and pause on a year they would like to analyze. For the color, I chose to go with one as it didn't make sense to me to give every country its own separate color. I went with a lighter shade of blue to allow for the country label in the column to be easy to read. This chart was made as an extra supplement while I was playing with the Flouish tool.
  I also created a packed circles chart for this data. In order to do this one, I had to organize the data and then I decided to calculate the average debt to GDP ratio for each country from 1995-2019. This is different from the grid of line chart which provided a visual data point for every year. Using the average allows for the easy creation of corresponding circle size based on how large a country's debt to GDP ratio was over that time period. This allows the viewer to quickly observe which countries are largest or smallest based on the circle size. I wanted to make more of the circles gray and only color a few to highlight some countries but I could not figure out how to do this in Flourish.
