# Nick-Bellavia-Portfolio
My Portfolio for Telling Stories Through Data

# About Me
My name is Nick and I am a student at the Heinz College in the part-time Masters of Public Management program. I am also a staff member at CMU in the department of University Advancement. After I complete the program, I am not sure what is next but I am keeping my options open.

## What I Hope to Learn
I am excited to learn about new and effective ways to tell different stories using data as well as learning more about color usage and different tools to populate data and make visualizations. It seems like having a good ability to make nice visualization that connect with people is becoming increasingly relevant to many different careers. I also look forward to posting projects in this portfolio to hopefully use, share, and reflect upon.

# Visualization Description

  The first data visualization I tried to construct was a column chart race. I mainly chose this one to see if I could play with the data and set it up in a way that it would work for this visualization. I think this type of chart works for this data because it shows in a brief amount of time the change that these countries experience in their debt to GDP ratio. It also allows the viewer to interact with the visualization and pause on a year they would like to analyze. For the color, I chose to go with one as it didn't make sense to me to give every country its own separate color. I went with a lighter shade of blue to allow for the country label in the column to be easy to read. This chart was made as an extra supplement while I was playing with the Flouish tool.
  I also created a packed circles chart for this data. In order to do this one, I had to organize the data and then I decided to calculate the average debt to GDP ratio for each country from 1995-2019. This is different from the grid of line chart which provided a visual data point for every year. Using the average allows for the easy creation of corresponding circle size based on how large a country's debt to GDP ratio was over that time period. This allows the viewer to quickly observe which countries are largest or smallest based on the circle size. I wanted to make more of the circles gray and only color a few to highlight some countries but I could not figure out how to do this in Flourish.
