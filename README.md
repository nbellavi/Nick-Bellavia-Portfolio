# Nick-Bellavia-Portfolio
My Portfolio for Telling Stories Through Data

# About Me
My name is Nick and I am a student at the Heinz College in the part-time Masters of Public Management. I am also a staff member at CMU in the department of University Advancement. After I complete the program, I am not sure what is next but I am keeping my options open.

## What I Hope to Learn
I am excited to learn about new and effective ways to tell different stories using data as well as learning more about color usage and different tools to populate data and make visualizations. It seems like having a good ability to make nice visualization that connect with people is becoming increasingly relevant to many different careers. I also look forward to posting projects in this portfolio to hopefully use, share, and reflect on.
